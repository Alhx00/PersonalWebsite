                  <p>I am a graduate with a degree in molecular biology and was premed. Sometime before senior year I came to the realization I did not want to pursue medicine anymore. Something that I enjoyed doing was the research aspect of my major. I had the opportunity to learn R during my time at college. I also had the opportunity to take an Introduction to Programming class my senior year. In that class I was able to learn the fundamentals of Python and C++. After doing some research on software engineering jobs I decided software engineering was something I wanted to do. I knew that to pursue software engineering I needed to have more fundamentals. I joined co-op careers to help me develop career wise. There I was able to learn essential data analytics skills such as Excel, Sql, Python, Tableau, and Google Analytics.</p>
